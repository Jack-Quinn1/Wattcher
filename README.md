<h1>Installation and Usage</h1>
To get started with the Energy Consumption Dashboard, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the command git clone 

Navigate to the project directory of server and client

Run npm install for both client and server to install the required dependencies for the project.

After installation is complete, run npm run dev for server and npm start for client to start the development server.

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Note that the npm start command will start the development server and automatically open your default browser to http://localhost:3000. If you need to run the application on a different port, you can specify the port number using the -p flag, like this: npm start -p 8080.

Additionally, if you need to build the project for production, you can use the npm run build command. This will create a production-ready build in the build directory that you can deploy to a web server.
